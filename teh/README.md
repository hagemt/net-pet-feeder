# Raspberry Pi

Python files are a daemon for mouse events (pedal) and script (ngrok) for cron job.

The `Makefile` builds `cats.c` and uses `cats.js` to parse `/dev/input` events.

Only `.py` files are necessary for the project to work; other stuff is R&D.

The `.sh` file and `crontab` included refer to a single log file.
